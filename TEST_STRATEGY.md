# 🧪 SimpliPass Testing Strategy

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for SimpliPass, a secure cross-platform password manager built with React Native Web. The strategy follows the testing pyramid approach with a focus on security-critical functions and multi-platform compatibility.

## 🎯 Platform Architecture

SimpliPass targets multiple platforms:
- **Web**: Chrome Extension (popup, content script, background script)
- **Mobile**: iOS and Android apps
- **Shared Core**: React Native Web components and business logic

### **Platform-Specific Considerations**
- **Web**: Chrome APIs, DOM manipulation, extension permissions
- **Mobile**: Native APIs, biometric authentication, offline storage
- **Shared**: Core logic, UI components, state management

Other considerations:
- This file is your guideline to perform every steps and tasks
- Do not forget to update the tasks by checking the boxes when a task is done
- Always use the best coding and test practices. If necessary, search on the web for answers and fixes
- When all tasks of a step are done, run the tests and check for errors
- Then, run lint error, types check, storybook and run build
- If any error occurs, iterate to fix until it works. If necessary, search on the web for answers and fixes
- Move on to the next step only once there is no remaining errors.
- When you need specific data from me, ask me to provide them or to add them (UserSecretKey, content_encrypted, item_key...)

### **Best Practices**

#### ✅ General Testing Principles

- Test a single behavior per test — keep each test focused and minimal
- Use clear and descriptive test names (e.g. `should decrypt correctly with valid key`)
- Always test both success and failure cases (e.g. invalid input, corrupted data)
- Target edge cases: empty values, undefined/null, incorrect formats, timeouts
- Avoid testing implementation details — test public behavior
- Keep tests short, readable, and independent
- Never depend on external services or live APIs — use mocks/stubs
- Keep test execution fast — slow tests discourage regular runs
- Group related tests using `describe(...)`, and keep structure consistent
- Use colocated `__tests__/` folders adjacent to the modules/components they cover
- Do not use `any` in test files unless strictly necessary
- Use `testID` and `accessibilityLabel` for all interactive components
- Prefer accessibility queries over `className` or text matching for UI
- Use `beforeEach` only when setup is repeated across many tests — avoid overuse

#### ✅ Test Structure & File Organization

- ✅ Split large test suites (>300 lines) into smaller files by domain:
  - `crypto.test.ts`, `storage.test.ts`, `items.test.ts`, `platform.test.ts`, etc.
- ✅ Keep one feature or functional area per test file (`describe` block granularity ≠ file granularity)
- ✅ Use shared mocks and constants in `__tests__/helpers/` to avoid repetition and noise
- ✅ Move environment setup (e.g. `global.crypto`, `window.location`) into `jest.setup.ts` to keep test files clean

#### ✅ Naming & Readability

- ✅ Write test names as complete sentences or clear expectations (e.g. `throws if decryption is attempted with an invalid key`)
- ✅ Use `describe()` blocks to reflect the business logic being validated (e.g. `Memory Clearing on Logout`)
- ✅ Avoid embedded logic or branching inside tests — keep tests declarative and behavior-driven

#### ✅ Mocking & Isolation

- ✅ Never rely on global state unless explicitly set/reset in `beforeEach`
- ✅ Avoid direct calls to production environment logic (e.g. Chrome APIs, live storage)
- ✅ Use platform conditionals (`isWeb`, `isExtension`, `isMobile`) sparingly — test core logic independently first

#### ✅ Security & Behavior Coverage

- ✅ Always test:
  - Encrypted values are not readable (no plaintext)
  - Decryption fails with invalid key or corrupted data
  - Logout and session cleanup purge all sensitive memory and storage
- ✅ Verify logs, caches, and local storage never retain sensitive information (e.g. passwords, card numbers)
- ✅ Validate access control boundaries: data isolation per user, per platform

#### ✅ Maintenance & Scalability

- ✅ Group constants and test data fixtures in shared test utils
- ✅ If a test grows in scope (e.g. 10+ `it()` blocks), evaluate whether to split it
- ✅ Use consistent naming patterns across all test files for easier filtering/searching (e.g. `getAllItems → items.test.ts`)
- ✅ Keep logic out of the test body — use `helpers/addTestCredential()` or `helpers/setupUserContext()` instead

#### ✅ What Makes a Good Test

- ✅ Reads like a sentence: `should return null if password is empty`
- ✅ Fails only when a real behavior breaks (not fragile)
- ✅ Protects business-critical logic from regressions
- ✅ Executes in under 100ms (unit/component)
- ✅ Runs on every save in watch mode (dev feedback loop)
- ✅ Can be understood without context or comments
- ✅ Does not require reading the source code to understand
- ✅ Gives clear error messages when it fails

#### ✅ SimpliPass-Specific Expectations for Cursor

- All functions in `logic/`, `utils/`, and `hooks/` must be covered by tests
- All UI components in `components/` must be tested using React Testing Library
- Use absolute imports in test files (`@core`, `@app`, etc.)
- Move all reusable mocks or test setup logic into `__tests__/helpers/`
- Do not write new business logic without tests
- Do not create new components without a Storybook story and at least one test
- All tests must pass before pushing to main or merging into production branches
- After major changes, always run:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  npm run test
  npm run build
  npm run storybook
  ```


## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Focus on security-critical tests first
2. **Implement incrementally**: Add tests as you develop features
3. **Automate early**: Set up CI/CD from the beginning
4. **Monitor continuously**: Track coverage and quality metrics
5. **Iterate regularly**: Update tests based on feedback and new requirements
6. **Test cross-platform**: Ensure all tests work across web and mobile
7. **Platform-specific testing**: Add platform-specific tests where needed
8. **Shared test utilities**: Create reusable test helpers for common scenarios

*This testing strategy ensures comprehensive coverage of SimpliPass functionality across all platforms (Web Chrome Extension and Mobile iOS/Android) while maintaining focus on security and user experience. The strategy maximizes shared test coverage while adding platform-specific tests where necessary.*
